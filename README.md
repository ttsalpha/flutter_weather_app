## Quick Start

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. For help getting started with Flutter,
view our [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance
on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Development Setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some
kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

- Clone this repo.
- Go to project root and execute the following command in console to get the required dependencies:
  ```sh
  flutter pub get
  ```
- `flutter devices` should list all the devices it sees. And then `flutter run -d foo` where "foo"
  is some part of the device name or ID should run on a specific device.
  ```
  # iOS device in debug mode
  flutter run -d iph
  ```
